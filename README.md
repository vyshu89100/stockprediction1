# Stock Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the future prices of stocks using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project uses historical data of stock prices from Yahoo Finance, and applies various algorithms, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to train and evaluate different models. The goal is to create a model that can accurately forecast the stock prices for a given time horizon.

## Data Analysis

The project performs some basic data analysis, such as descriptive statistics, line charts, candlestick charts, and correlation analysis, to explore the data and understand the trends and patterns of the stock prices. Some of the findings are:

- The stock prices are highly volatile and fluctuate over time, depending on the market conditions and the company performance.
- The stock prices tend to follow a seasonal pattern, with higher prices in the beginning and the end of the year, and lower prices in the middle of the year.
- The stock prices are positively correlated with each other, meaning that they move in the same direction most of the time.

## Feature Engineering

The project performs some feature engineering, such as imputing missing values, creating new features, scaling numerical variables, and splitting the data into train and test sets, to prepare the data for modeling. Some of the steps are:

- Imputing the missing values in the data with the mean or median of the corresponding column, depending on the distribution of the data.
- Creating new features, such as moving averages, returns, volatility, and momentum, to capture the temporal and statistical aspects of the stock prices.
- Scaling the numerical variables, such as the prices and the volume, with min-max scaling or standardization, to make them comparable and reduce the effect of outliers.
- Splitting the data into train and test sets, with a ratio of 80:20, to evaluate the performance of the models on unseen data.

## Modeling

The project applies two different machine learning algorithms to train and evaluate the models, using the training data and cross-validation. The algorithms are:

- Linear Regression
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

The project uses mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) as the main metrics to compare the performance of the models, as well as other metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The project also plots the actual and predicted stock prices for each model, to visualize the accuracy and the error of the predictions.

The project selects the best model based on the lowest MSE and RMSE scores on the test data, and applies it to the future data to generate the forecasts. The project then plots the historical and forecasted stock prices, and calculates the confidence intervals for the forecasts.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates how to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to a stock price prediction problem, using historical data of stock prices from Yahoo Finance. The project shows how to perform data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling, and how to evaluate and compare different models. The project also shows how to generate and plot the forecasts for the future stock prices, and how to calculate the confidence intervals for the forecasts.

The project can be further improved by trying more advanced algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformer networks, or by tuning the hyperparameters of the existing algorithms, using grid search or random search. The project can also be extended by adding more features, such as sentiment analysis, news headlines, or technical indicators, or by applying more sophisticated feature engineering techniques, such as feature selection, feature extraction, or feature interaction.
